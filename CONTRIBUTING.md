# Guidance on how to contribute

There are many ways to help:
- [Using GitHub stars and discussions](#using-github-start-and-discussions)
- [Using the issue tracker](#using-the-issue-tracker)
- [Changing the code-base](#changing-the-code-base)

## Using GitHub stars and discussions

The most simple way to help the project - Press the **Star** button if you like the project.

Your participation in [discussions][discussions-path] will also be useful.

Press the **Eye** button to watch for changes.

## Using the issue tracker

Use the [issue tracker][issues-path]
to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the [issue tracker][issues-path]  to find ways to contribute. 
Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.

## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should **fork** this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a **pull request**. All new code should have associated
unit tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.
