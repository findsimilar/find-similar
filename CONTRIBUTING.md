# Developer Guidelines

## How to report an issue

* You can find all the project issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/findsimilar/find-similar/issues)
* If you found a bug, you can [create new issue](https://github.com/findsimilar/find-similar/issues/new) with the bug label

## How to write a code

First you can check [existing issues](https://github.com/findsimilar/find-similar/issues). Pick one or create your own.

* Create "Fork" of the project
* To run the project and tests see [Developer documentation](https://github.com/findsimilar/find-similar/blob/master/DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION.md)
* Do some changes locally
* Create pull request to this repository (you can use git or "Contribute" button at the top of your local repository)

## How development is usually done

The most involved people are the [members of organization](https://github.com/orgs/findsimilar/people). 
They can make code review and accept pull requests.
But any person can be involved report a bug of release a patch.
We are always open to new people.
New most involved contributors can become members of the organization

## Interaction with other developers

Now we use issues and comments in pull requests.

If you need something else like:
* forum 
* or realtime chat 
* mail list
* of discussions on GitHub

Mail to [quill@craftsman.lol](mailto:quill@craftsman.lol) and we will discuss this.
