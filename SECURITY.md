# Security Policy

## Vulnerability Reporting
We provide a clear process for reporting security vulnerabilities. 

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** create an issue on GitHub.
Instead, please email us at [quill@craftsman.lol](mailto:quill@craftsman.lol). 
We will acknowledge your report, conduct an investigation, and work on a resolution.
